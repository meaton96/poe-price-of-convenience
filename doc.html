        <h2>Project Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
            I knew that there were many third party apps created for the game Path of Exile. Despite its small size, 
            the game draws the kind of people who like to solve problems by creating tools. So, I knew that there was a way to pull
            data from APIs as I use many of these tools myself. I was able to find .json data from bulk trading and from poe.ninja that I could use.
            
        </p>
        <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
        <p>
            I wanted to create something that might actually be useful so I went ahead with the idea. It took me about 5 hours to get the basic API calls working but I figured
            that would be the hard part.
            <br>
            I had to use a CORS proxy to get around the CORS issue. I used the CORS proxy from <a href="https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere">this repo</a>.
            <br>
            I was able to pull data from <a href="https://poe.ninja/">poe.ninja</a> using the CORS proxy and following a guide from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexiledev/">POE Dev reddit</a>
            on how to get the API urls.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I had to tackle the github API. I followed the guide <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/quickstart?apiVersion=2022-11-28&tool=javascript">here</a> to get the API calls working.
            This took a while trying to get all the async and fetch functions working. Since I was pulling data from a public repo I didn't need to use an access token or log in.
            <br>
            Also for some reason the github API would only return information on the repo so I had to grab the raw download url and make a second API call to get the actual data.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I had the data displaying it was easy.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Process</h2>
        <p>
            I had the data I wanted to display and compare so I starteed with HTML and CSS to get the basic layout. I went back and forth between grid and flexbox trying to get 
            my javascript to send code to a specific grid column didn't work so I ended up using flexbox for everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            I, then, worked on the javascript to filter the data so I only had similar data entries to compare. Of course the data from each API was different so one was json.lines and one was json.data. 
            So I had to code every function for two different data sources. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I thought that comparing the data would be easy but turned out that the data from each source also had different variable names for the number I needed to fetch. It also turns out that the data from both sources
            also changed. So sometimes the data from poe.ninja was 'chaosEquivalent' and sometimes it was 'chaosValue'. I had to code for both. Sometimes the data from the github repo was using shortened names so I had to hardcode
            to account for that as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            After all of that I was able to display the data on the site. I ended up using data for four different <em>types</em> of data. The data was split into categories in the repo and on poe.ninja.
            Which brings me to...
        </p>

        

        <h2>Additional Development</h2>
        <p>
            There is a signifigant amount of more data on the TFT bulk repo. The rest of the data would all require a new function or functions to be written to get and compare the correct information.
            <br>For example: <br>
            The data in the sets.json contains data for sets of items. I would need to get the value of the set, hard code for its name, then fetch data from the poe.ninja API for each item of that set.
            I just did not have the time to implement this as I would have liked.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future I would like to:
            <ul>
                <li>Get the rest of the TFT bulk data and code for each item type to display more information on the site.</li>
                <li>Add support for other leagues - currently data is only pulled from the 'league softcore' data folder. 
                    This is the main way people play the game, but there are two other league types that I could display data for.</li>
                <li>Potentially integrate this with the TFT discord in some way. Although they already have their own bulk selling tools, mine is more of just an information display</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Data pulled from 2 API sources</li>
            <li>Data is displayed neatly on the webpage after being compared</li>
            <li>A spinning progress bar is displayed while data is loading</li>
            <li>Site is fully responsive from ~350px width to 4096px and works on mobile (if a little small)</li>
            <li>The type of data the user was looking at is stored in local storage and is loaded on page load instead of the welcome message
                <ul>
                    <li>So if the user had the <em>beasts</em> tab open before, when they load the site that information will be displayed to them</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Data is also cached in the session storage when it is loaded. It will be loaded instead of an additional API call. This reduces API calls and improves user experience.
                <ul>
                    <li>One issue with this is that the data will always be read in over an API call so if the user has their browser open for a long time, the data will be out of date. At some point it should forcibly update if the data 
                        in the session storage is too old. This has not been implemented</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>HTML and CSS are fully valid with no javascript errors thrown</li>
            <li>Controls</li>
            <ul>
                <li>API "searches" are done by clicking the navigation on the left. This pulls all of a specific data type.</li>
                <li>Data can be filterd by name by typing in the bar at the top of the results</li>
                <li>Data can be sorted using either poe.ninja data or the TFT data.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sorting the data in one column will match the other column by name in order to display the information side by side</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Other Potential Controls I did not have time to make</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A way to switch between standard and league information</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I started making this and realized there was almost no data in the Standard folder in the TFT repo</li>
                </ul>
                <li>A dropdown to set a minimum chaos value to display so you don't see items below a certain value</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All images were pulled from the Path of Exile CDN. Links to each image are available <a href="https://gist.github.com/sean-clayton/3757cf3512b9a555f447489811a946b7">here</a></li>
