		<h2>Welcome to POE Price of Convenience</h2>
		<p>
			Contrary to how bulk sales work in the real world, in the action role-player game Path of Exile (POE), bulk sales are often more expensive than buying items individually.
			This is because items are often sold in small quanities by players and are purchased and marked up by other players who then sell them in bulk.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is the <em>Price of Convenience.</em> It is still often much better to purhase items in bulk to save time.
		</p>
		<p>
			POE Price of Convenience is a tool that allows you to compare the price of buying items in bulk versus buying them individually.
		</p>
		<p>
			Specifically this website will show the price difference between using the third party discord <em>The Forbidden Trove (TFT)</em> and the official POE trade website by pulling data from poe.ninja.
			Find much more detailed currency and item price data at <a href="https://poe.ninja/">poe.ninja</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Select a category on the left to get started. You can filter data by name and sort data by clicking a column header.
		</p>
		<div id="disclaimer">

			<em>Disclaimer: This website currently only shows data for the current soft core league. After about a month into each league the data from 
				TFT may be limited as they remove some items from their bulk shops. The data is also unlikely to change much during this time.
